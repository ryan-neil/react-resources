# Roll Dice App

This is a React State Exercise.

Basically, we will be building an app that lets us roll a pair of dice. That's it.

This exercise practices working with __props__, __defaultProps__, __state__, and simple __click events__ in React.

## Step 1: Component Structure
Make two components:
  * _RollDice_ - a parent component (rendered by App) that renders the dice and a button to roll.
  * _Die_ - an individual die that takes props and displays the correct face of the die based on props.

## Step 2: Making Dice
We will be using Font Awesome to display our dice:
```html
<i class="fas fa-dice-one"></i>
<i class="fas fa-dice-two"></i>
<i class="fas fa-dice-three"></i>
<!-- etc... -->
```

To install font awesome for your React application, go into public/index.html and in the <head> tag, insert the font-awesome CDN.

Your `Die.js` component would just be an icon that dynamically changes its class to the proper die face based on props from the parent componentâ€™s state. 

## Step 3: Rolling Dice
The RollDice component should have:

  * the state for both of the dice
  * a `roll()` method that rolls them to randomly get a new result

You can use _defaultProps_ to set an array of six possible faces for each die.

Your _roll_ method can pick a random element from the array for each die, then update the state, causing the dice to re-render to the appropriate values.

Remember that these values will have to be translated into fas `fa-dice-one` through fas `fa-dice-six` for the child component to receive the appropriate class name through its props.

Do you have to store each class name in the array or can you programmatically decide which one the _Die_ components should have?


## Step 4: Bonus

### Animation
The solution displays an animation every time the dice are rolled.

A new piece of state is necessary to say whether the dice are currently rolling or not.

This is done by appending a class containing a CSS animation, and then removing it after one second (hint: `setTimeout` with `setState`, but be careful what `this` references!).

### Changing Button Text
The button can also dynamically change its text and become disabled (un-clickable) until the animation has completed.

It relies on the additional piece of state that says whether the dice are currently rolling or not.
