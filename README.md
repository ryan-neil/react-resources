# 3. What is React?

Basically, React is a frontend framework/library/whatever it is, it's pretty sweet. It was created by the folks over at Meta (Facebook).

### What does React actually do?

The main point of React is to build _components_. Components are reusable pieces of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that are combined into one, modular component or one piece of an application. These pieces (components) can then be used to build or compose a larger application.

At the end of the day, React apps consist of a bunch of small components that are then combined and built up into larger pieces until we have an entire application.

React out of the box is less feature-rich than a framework like Angular. However, when developers write large React apps they are usually using other React-specific tools. These are things like, React Router, Redux, etc.

# 4. Components
  * [Components and Props: React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)

Components are the building blocks of React. React quite literally exists to help you create components and then have those components communicate (pass data, pass information, methods, etc.) between one another.

_"Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation."_ - React Docs

One of the most difficult parts of a React app is figuring out what to make a component.
