# React Query

_Fetch, cache and update data in your React and React Native applications all without touching any "global state"._ - React Query Docs

The **React Query** library gives us out of the box state management for any kind of asynchronous data that we use. This could be from REST API, Promises, or anything else that involves fetching asynchronous data.

We have access to this functionality through a custom hook in React, `useQuery`. This hook manages a lot of stuff under the hood for us like caching the data after the initial fetch which gives us performance boosts. Also, refetching data in the background this way our app is always in sync with data. In addition, we have access to information about the requests that we make like, it's status, if it has any errors, etc.
