# Data Fetching App (Training)
  * [Video Tutorial (4:04:43):](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVFAyFWO4go&t=13481s) Dave Gray

## What we will be building:
This is a training exercise for building a data fetching application. To assist us we will be using [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) which provides a free fake REST API. We will be using the `/posts`, `/comments`, and `/users` resources from JSONPlaceholder. This will be a two part training exercise.

Part 1 will consist of 3 buttons spanning across the top of the page (_users_, _posts_, and _comments_). 

When we select `users` for example, it requests the associated resource from the JSONPlaceholder website. It then prints a list of all the objects we get back in JSON format. The same logic is repeated for the `posts` and `comments` as well.
